Bendr
=========

This is a slack bot used in the office for fairly frivolous purposes.
Anything merged into the mater branch is deployed automagically via codeship.

The bot will then listen on two routes:

    http://slack.orukusaki.co.uk/slack/slashcommand
    http://slack.orukusaki.co.uk/slack/webhook
    
I'm sure you can figure out which is which.
