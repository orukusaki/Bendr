Bendr
=========

This is a slack bot used in the office for fairly frivolous purposes.
Anything merged into the master branch is deployed automagically via codeship.

[ ![Codeship Status for orukusaki/Bendr](https://codeship.com/projects/600e95e0-039c-0133-0568-62fced7320b0/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/89215)

The bot will then listen on two routes:

    http://slack.orukusaki.co.uk/slack/slashcommand
    http://slack.orukusaki.co.uk/slack/webhook
    
I'm sure you can figure out which is which.
